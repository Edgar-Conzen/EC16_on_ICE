# EC16_on_ICE
EC16-CPU running ECMON @ 20MHz on an ICE40UP5K-SG48 (ICY40-Board)

* Complete Lattice Radiant project (2023.1.1.200.1 ) with VHDL sources for the EC16 CPU, 
  FART (115.200 Baud, 1 8,1,N) and ICY40 board specific files.

* EC16 assembler source code for the ECMON monitor program including ec16asm.py assembler
